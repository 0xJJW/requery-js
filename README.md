## Special Thanks

This project wouldn't exist without the Vue ecosystem. The reactive core is powered by [@vue/reactivity](https://github.com/vuejs/core/tree/main/packages/reactivity#readme), and the API design was inspired by [Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue). Thank you to Evan You and the Vue team for these incredible tools.
